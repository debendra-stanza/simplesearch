Harmonia was a West German musical "supergroup" formed in 1973 as a collaboration between members of two prominent krautrock bands: Michael Rother of Neu! with Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius of Cluster. Based in the countryside village of Forst, the trio released two albums in their initial incarnation: Musik von Harmonia (1974) and Deluxe (1975). They reformed between 2007 and 2009.

AllMusic described the group as "one of the most legendary in the entire krautrock/kosmische scene." Collaborator Brian Eno described them in the mid-1970s as "the world's most important rock group." Harmonia's work would influence the development of ambient music by Eno and albums by David Bowie.
